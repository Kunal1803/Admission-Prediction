# Admission prediction
Admission prediction typically refers to the process of estimating the likelihood of a student being admitted to a particular educational institution, such as a college or university. This prediction is often based on various factors, including academic performance, standardized test scores, extracurricular activities, letters of recommendation, and personal statements.
Several tools and algorithms have been developed to help predict admission chances, especially for colleges and universities that have a competitive admissions process. These tools may use historical data, statistical models, and machine learning algorithms to analyze patterns and trends in admissions decisions.
